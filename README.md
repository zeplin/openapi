This repository contains [OpenAPI descriptions](https://www.openapis.org) for the [Zeplin API](https://docs.zeplin.dev).

## What is OpenAPI

From the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0):

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.
